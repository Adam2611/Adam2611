### Hi there, I'm AdamðŸ‘‹

I'm a **computer engineering** student at the University of Waterloo. I specialize in Machine Learning and its applications, and have **professional** experience at [AltaML](https://altaml.com/), [Intact Labs](https://intactlab.ca/), [Carta](https://carta.com), [AMD](https://amd.com), and [Wisedocs.ai](https://wisedocs.ai), working with things like document classification, stutter detection, and image classification. I've also been involved in several medical AI initiatives in the past, through a startup called [House.ai](https://houseai.tech), which I founded!

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lam26/), and I'm always happy to chat!
